# TODO

1. Test the CLI:
    - with fish, zsh and bash.
    - test it while having 0 aliases and with some aliases and with alot of aliases.
2. Fix not showing anything when there's no aliases.
3. Create a way to categorize aliases:
    - You can create a syntax for pretty-alias to look for in aliases file.
    - Separate them visually when there is categories.
